# TikTok_Sentiment_Analysis

TikTok is the one of the social media platforms that made it to the top eight in 2023. The app has revolutionized the way we watch videos by introducing short videos.
Those who enjoy entertaining videos but can’t watch lengthy ones TikTok presents short 15 seconds videos shot on mobile devices or webcams.
With its personalized feeds of quirky shot videos set to music and sound effects, the app is notable for its addictive quality and high levels of engagement.
Amateur to professional creators can add effects Ike filters and background music, and stickers to their videos, and create split-screen duet videos even if they are in different locations
